# Winter Olympics Trivia - HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery

Winter Olympics Trivia is a simple browser-based game that asks the user trivia questions, records their responses, keeps track of their score, and allows them to replay.

In this project, I had the opportunity to experiment with a timer function, that resets with every question, and marks the answer wrong if it reaches 0. I also experimented with using a single game-space to display all game elements, rather than having separate areas for each item.

If you think you know the Winter Olympics, go in and give it a try!
